			<h2>The Myrtles' Plantation: "One of America's Most Haunted Homes"</h2>
		<hr /><!--I added a horizontal line tag here to make the webpage look more 
		presentable, separating the main title from the content.-->

			<h3>What is the Myrtles' Plantation?</h3>
			<p>The Myrtles' Plantation, a classic Southern mansion--now both a must-see 
			tourist attraction and a four-star bed & breakfast--is located in St. 
			Francisville, Louisiana, within driving distance to the famous city of New 
			Orleans and Baton Rouge. While it is often times praised for its beautiful 
			landscaping that stretches 9.9 acres (which includes the century-old willow 
			trees) and its architecture that is truly reflective of the Antebellum period, 
			the Myrtles' Plantation is also equipped with its own sinister ghost stories 
			and a legendary history. Featured in <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i> and <i>Ghost 
			Hunters</i>, year after year, the Plantation attracts an endless stream of 
			visitors that come in search for a good scare. </p>

			<h3>Historical Tales</h3> 
			<p>The history of the plantation, is surely, one filled with death, tragedy, 
			and despair. Built over a Native American burial ground by General David 
			Bradford in 1796, the Myrtles Plantation, originally known as the Laurel Grove, 
			passed through many families.</p>
			
				<p><b>Legend of the Woodruff Family</b><br />
				<!--Instead of making this a heading (<h4>), I included the title in the 
				paragraph and bolded it, so that I could eliminate the space in between 
				the title and actual paragraph. I thought this would make it look more 
				presentable.-->
					In 1817, the plantation purchased by Clark Woodruff and his wife, 
					Sara Mathilda Woodruff. According to the legend, Mr. Woodruff, a 
					promiscuous man, had an affair with the one of the house servants 
					named Chloe, who gave into his demands knowing that she would end up 
					working in the fields if she did not. Eventually, he grew tired of 
					Chloe and forced himself upon another woman. Feared the worst, she 
					began to eavesdrop on the family's private conversations, dreading the 
					mention of her name. However, she was soon caught, and as a punishment, 
					the Judge ordered that one of her ears be cut off. Since then, she 
					always wore a green turban that hid the ugly scar the knife left behind. 
					What happened next is still unclear. Some claim that Chloe began to 
					slowly poison the Woodruff family so that the family would simply get 
					sick and she would be able to nurse them back to health and be safe 
					from ever being sent to the fields. Though others say that her motives 
					were solely for one reason: revenge. For the Woodruff's oldest 
					daughter's birthday, Chloe baked a cake with a handful of very 
					poisonous oleander flowers. Both Sara and her daughters had a slice of 
					cake and died within a matter of hours, but Clark Woodruff was spared. 
					Frightened that they would be blamed for the deaths, the other slaves 
					dragged Chloe into the courtyard and hanged her on a tree. Her body was 
					weighed down with rocks and tossed into a nearby river.</p>
			 
			 <p><b>Ruffin Grey stirling and the "Myrtles"</b><br />
			 <!--Instead of making this a heading (<h4>), I included the title in the 
				paragraph and bolded it, so that I could eliminate the space in between 
				the title and actual paragraph. I thought this would make it look more 
				presentable.-->
			 		In 1834, Laurel Grove was purchased by Ruffin Grey Stirling who was 
			 		part of a wealthy family who owned several plantations in the South.
			 		He remodeled and renovated the home, which nearly doubled the size, 
			 		and it was renamed â€œthe Myrtles." Four years after the completion of 
			 		the project, Stirling died on July 17, 1854 of tuberculosis. He left 
			 		his wealth and property to the care of his wife, Mary Cobb. Furthermore, 
			 		the family was often visited by tragedy. Of nine children, only four 
			 		of them lived to be old enough to marry. The oldest son, Lewis, 
			 		died the same year as his father, and the husband of his daughter 
			 		was murdered on the front porch of the house after the Civil War. The 
			 		war itself wreaked havoc on the Myrtles Plantation and on the Stirling 
			 		family. Many of the family's personal belongings were looted and 
			 		destroyed by Union soldiers and the wealth that they had 
			 		accumulated was ultimately in worthless Confederate currency. To make 
			 		matters worse, Mary Cobb had invested heavily in sugar plantations 
			 		that had been ravaged by the war, so as a result, she eventually lost 
			 		all of her property. She died on August, 1880 and is buried next to 
			 		her husband in the family plot at Grace Church in St. Francisville.</p>
			 		
			 	<p><b>The Murder of William Winter</b><br />
			 	<!--Instead of making this a heading (<h4>), I included the title in the 
				paragraph and bolded it, so that I could eliminate the space in between 
				the title and actual paragraph. I thought this would make it look more 
				presentable.-->
			 		On December 5, 1865, Mary Cobb hired William Winter, her daughter's
			 		husband, to act as her attorney who would help her manage the 
			 		plantation lands. As part of the deal, she gave Sarah and William the 
			 		Myrtles as their home. Tragedy struck in 1871 when William Winter was 
			 		shot on his front porch and according to legend, staggered or crawled 
			 		up the stairs, but collapsed dead on the 17th step.</p>
		
		<h3>Accounts of Paranormal Activity</h3> 
			<p>The Myrtles' Plantation hosts much paranormal activity and ghostly phenomena
			as it is home to over 12 different ghosts, each with its own haunting past. 
			Additionally, it is rumored that it has been the scene of ten murders.
		
			<!--Add a blank line tag in between these sentences to eliminate the gap, which 
			makes it look more pleasing to the eye (it makes it 'flow' better). The next 
			bit of information is still about the paranormal activity that occurs in the 
			mansion, but about a specific sighting. -->
			<br />Since Chloe's death, she has been spotted several times in the mansion, 
			though one of her most famous encounter was captured on camera. In the famous 
			black and white photograph, some say you can see the shape of Chloe hiding 
			around the side of the house--almost out of sight--as if she does not want
			to be caught. Additionally, she is often seen during the nighttime, wandering
			the grounds in her green turban while you can hear the cries of little children. 
			Guests have also reported being woken up in the middle of the night to the 
			frightening sight of Chloe, staring at them from the side of the bed. 
			Yet, Chloe is, of course, not the only ghost reported to be haunting the 
			Myrtles' Plantation. The house is reportedly built over an Indian burial ground, 
			so there is, allegedly, a ghost of a young Native American woman. There are 
			also ghostly sightings of William Winter, and there is famous mirror inside 
			the plantation that's rumored to hold the spirits of Sara and her two murdered 
			children. Often times people will see them reflecting back or will find 
			handprints on the glass.</p>

		<h3>Testimonies</h3> 
		<!--The following are reviews from tourists who enjoyed their experience at the 
		plantation. Be sure to place blockquote tagas for indentation and as well as 
		italicize their testimonies. -->
		
			<p><blockquote><i>We will definitely be returning to stay in another section of 
			the house where another visitor got a picture of an apparition on the well known 
			staircase. Clearly, the most haunted place in America! </i> -Faith Smith 
			</blockquote></p> 
		
			<p><blockquote><i>Stayed for the night, and during our visit my wife and I were
			had a bone-chilling experience. As we were touring the house at night (which 
			by the way, HUGE kudos to our amazing tour guide, Sarah), we entered the room 
			containing the 'haunted mirror'. Well...it was indeed, haunted. As we looked 
			at our reflections in the mirror, we were absolutely horrified to see the 
			ghosts of Sara Woodruff and her daughters. Wish we were able to capture them 
			on the camera, but I guess you'll have to visit and experience it for yourself! 
			10/10 I would highly recommend! </i> -Doug Campbell </blockquote></p>
